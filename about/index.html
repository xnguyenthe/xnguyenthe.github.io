  Hello! I'll assume you'd expect me to write about some glorified version of myself, where
  I'd cook up all sorts of skills and positive attributes I possess. Well... to my, and probably
  also your, dissapointment I'd feel rather dishonest doing that. So here is a look at
  Bao Dat NGUYEN THE through the critical prism of his own judgement of his life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm an exceptionally mediocre student of informatics, who never had any aspirations for
    becoming a computer scientist. My high school majors were maths, physics, Slovak, English
    and German. My past self was suffering from an illusion, that somehow maths and physics would
    match well with informatics, or at the very minimum help facilitate it. Little did I know, I'd be
    really teeerrible and Informatics and barely even average (read: "sub-abeverage") at Informatics.
    But one must simply carry on what one has begun. If you're looking to hire me, you're just
    going to have to take a chance on me. I'll try to do my best.
  </p>

  <p>My original aspirations were work in the field of linguistics or interpretation. That didn't
    come to fruition, although I do still harbour a loving sentiment towards those fields. Now in
    the case of computer science, even though I'm really not good at it, I see great potential
    for the future (if not of myself, at least of humanity). I take particular interest in
    artificial intelligence, in particular neural networks. I try to do research in the field
    of AI natural language processing.
